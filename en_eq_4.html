<li>When going outside, check that there is no risk of falling objects such as roof tiles and windows.</li>
<li>Do not stand near sloping buildings as they may collapse.</li>
<li>When feeling an earthquake near the sea, evacuate to higher ground.</li>
<li>When there is no damage to your home or risk of fire in your area, do not be in a hurry to evacuate.</li>
<li> Check in advance for a place of safety in your area, and for wide routes that lead to safety on foot. </li>
<li> Do not go to places where a landslide is likely to occur.</li>
<li>Talk to the children to give them a sense of safety. </li>
